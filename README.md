Include a README that covers:

- How long you spent on the assignment.
- What you like about your implementation.
- What you would change if you were going to do it again.
- How you made your design decisions. For example, if you looked at other timer apps/webapps for inspiration, please note that.
- How you would test this if you had more time.

If you did not use the starter code, please also include instructions on how to build and run your project so we can see and interact with the timer webapp you built.
